  <!-- Introduction -->
  <div class="para">
    <p> The culture of Sri Lanka has been influenced by many factors but has managed to retain much of its ancient aspects. Mostly it has been influenced by its long history and its Buddhist heritage. The country has a rich artistic tradition, embracing the fine arts, including music, dance, and visual arts. Sri Lankan lifestyle is reflected in the cuisine, festivals, and sports. There are some influences from colonisation by the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the British. Sri Lankan culture is best known abroad for its cricket, holistic medicine, religious icons like the Buddhist flag, and cultural exports such as tea, cinnamon and gems. Sri Lankan culture is diverse, as it varies from region to region. <br><br>
        Sri Lanka has had ties with Indian subcontinent from ancient times. Demographics: Sinhalese 74.8%, Sri Lankan Moors 9.23%, Indian Tamil 4.16%, Sri Lankan Tamil 11.21%, Other 0.6%. <br><br>
        Sri Lanka boasts of a documented history of over 2000 years mainly due to ancient historic scriptures like Mahawansa. Several centuries of intermittent foreign influence, has transformed Sri Lankan culture to the present outlook. Nevertheless ancient traditions and festivals are celebrated by mostly conservative Sinhalese people of the island, together with other minorities that make up the Sri Lankan identity.

    <h1> 1.Religion </h1>

  </div>
   
  <div class="para">
    <p>The freedom to choose and express religious affiliation is guaranteed under the Sri Lankan constitution. Buddhism is the major religion followed in Sri Lanka, with 70.2% of the population identifying as Buddhist.1 Of the remaining Sri Lankan population, 12.6% identify as Hindu, 9.7% identify as Muslim and 6.1% identify as Christian.2 <br><br>
      The social landscape of the country tends to show an association between ethnicity and religion. The Sinhalese majority generally follows Buddhism, which has seen the faith gain special status over other religions despite not being the official religion of the country. Those who identify as Hindu tend to be ethnic Tamils, while those who identify as Muslim are generally Sri Lankan Moors. Christians are typically Burghers. That being said, identifying with a particular religion is not necessarily connected to one’s ethnicity. For example, there are some Sri Lankans who identify as Christian that are of Sinhalese or Tamil ethnicity. Moreover, it is common to find the various religions coexisting. Buddhists may visit Hindu temples to pay homage to the Buddha, and churches may be in close proximity to mosques.

  <div class="para">
    <p>Many forms of Sri Lankan arts and crafts take inspiration from the Island&#39;s long and lasting Buddhist culture which in turn has absorbed and adopted countless regional and local traditions. In most instances Sri Lankan art originates from religious beliefs, and are represented in many forms such as painting, sculpture, and architecture. One of the most notable aspects of Sri Lankan art are caves and temple paintings, such as the frescoes found in Sigiriya and religious paintings found in temples in Dambulla and Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy. Other popular forms of art have been influenced by both natives as well as outside settlers. For example, traditional wooden handicrafts and clay pottery are found around the hill country while Portuguese-inspired lacework and Indonesian-inspired Batik have become notable.

    <h1> 3.Spices </h1>

  </div>
   
  <div class="para">
    <p>Sri Lanka has long been renowned for its spices. The best known is Cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum/ Cinnamomum zeylanicum) which is native to Sri Lanka. In the 15th and 16th centuries, spice and ivory traders from all over the world who came to Sri Lanka brought their native cuisines to the island, resulting in a rich diversity of cooking styles and techniques. Lamprais rice boiled in stock with a special curry, accompanied by frikkadels (meatballs), all of which is then wrapped in a banana leaf and baked as a Dutch-influenced Sri Lankan dish. Dutch and Portuguese sweets also continue to be popular. British influences include roast beef and roast chicken. The influence of Indian cooking methods and food has played a major role in what Sri Lankans eat. <br> <br>
      Sri Lankans use spices liberally in their dishes and typically do not follow an exact recipe: thus, every cook&#39;s curry will taste slightly different. Furthermore, people from different regions of the island (for instance, hill-country dwellers versus coastal dwellers) traditionally cook in different ways. Sri Lankan cuisine is known to be among the world's spiciest, due to the high use of different varieties of chilli peppers referred to as amu miris (Chili pepper), kochchi miris, and maalu miris (Banana pepper) (capsicum) and in Tamil Milakaai, among others. It is generally accepted for tourists to request that the food is cooked with a lower chilli content to cater for the more sensitive Western palette. Food cooked for public occasions typically uses less chilli than food cooked in the home, the latter where the food is cooked with the chilli content preferable to the occupants.

  <div class="para">
    <p>The Sinhala and Tamil New Year (“Aluth Avurudhu”; in Sinhala, “Puthiyathandu”; in Tamil) is a very large cultural event on the island. The festival falls in April (also known as the month of Bak) when the sun moves from the Meena Rashiya (House of Pisces) to the Mesha Rashiya (House of Aries).<br><br>
      Unusually, both the end of one year and the beginning of the next occur not at midnight but at separate times determined by astrologers with a period of some hours between (the “nona gath”; or neutral period) being a time where one is expected to refrain from all types of work and instead engage solely in relaxing religious activities and traditional games. During the New Year, festivities both children and adults will often don traditional outfits. But the clothes must be washed and very  clean because it should be southam (pure).
